# Neural-Network-Number-Guesser
The Neural Network Number Guesser takes in the drawn digit from the user and uses a Convolutional Neural Network model to predict the drawn digit.

## Background Info
Some prerequesite knowledge of machine learning and how to implement a Convolutional Neural Network may be needed to fully understand how the model is working. To get a quick start on understanding the principles of machine learning, I recommend [The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book](http://ema.cri-info.cm/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019BurkovTheHundred-pageMachineLearning.pdf) and for the more mathematically inclined, [Mathematics For Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf) in conjunction with the previous text will cover a lot of basis.
For implementing a Convolutional Neural Network, I recommend Kaggle's [Computer Vision](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision) tutorial.

## Getting Started
### Cloning
To get started, clone the repo by running the following in the command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/anthonypiegaro/Neural-Network-Number-Guesser.git
```
### Virtual Environment
After cloning, I would also recommend creating a [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). This can be done by running the follwing:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Then, you should activate your newly created virtual environment. You can do this by running the following in the command line:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Now, you virtual environment should be activated.
### Downloading Dependecies
For this project, there a few dependencies that will be needed in order for the project to run. These dependencies are stored ni the requirements.txt file. Luckly, it is very easy to download these to your virtual environment.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
You now should have all the dependencies downloaded and ready to go.
